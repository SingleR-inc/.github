# Cell type annotation for single-cell data

This organization manages the code for the [**SingleR** Bioconductor package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleR) and associated resources.
(No, we're not really a corporation, it's just that the **@SingleR** handle was already taken.)

To get started, check out one or more of the links below:

- The Bioconductor [landing page](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleR).
- The [GitHub page for the R package](https://github.com/SingleR-inc/SingleR).
- The [book for the package](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/SingleRBook/).

Python users may also be interested in [the Python implementation](https://github.com/BiocPy/singler).

The cool logo was derived from [the sticker for the package](https://github.com/Bioconductor/BiocStickers/tree/devel/SingleR).
